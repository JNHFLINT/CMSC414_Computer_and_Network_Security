# ⚙️ How to run ⚙️

1) Download both tcp_server.py and tcp_client.py files
2) At first, run the tcp_server.py file. When run correctly, it should say "The server is ready to receive" and "waiting".
3) Now run the tcp_client.py file. If done correctly, the client side should have options and will be waiting for an input. Give any sentence you like and then options 1-5 (format #,#,#,#,#).
4) Finally, they will be sent over to the server where those options will be performed and then sent back to the client. The server can still take new connections.
